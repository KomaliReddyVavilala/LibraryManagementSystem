# Library Management System

A simple Java-based console application to manage books, issue and return them for library members.

## Features
- Add new members
- View all books
- Issue and return books
- Check book availability

Key tasks included:
- Designing a book catalog with features to view all books and check their availability.
- Implementing member registration and management.
- Creating functionality to issue and return books with proper status updates.
- Handling input from users through a menu-driven interface.

We used Java and the Jakarta API to build this application. The final system allows users to track books and members, ensuring smooth library operations without manual record-keeping.

During development, we tackled challenges like managing member data dynamically and ensuring accurate book availability status, which were addressed by implementing appropriate data structures and methods.

Overall, this project helped us understand object-oriented programming concepts and basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Java.
